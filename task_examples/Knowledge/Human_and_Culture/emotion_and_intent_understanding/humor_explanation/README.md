Example Question: caption: First you must gain their trust.
Example Response: Answer: A lab scientist usually sees them as separate from their test subjects, especially when the subjects are mice. The funny part here is that the scientist dressed in the mouse outfit is trying to relate to their subjects (i.e., the mice in the cages) emotionally (i.e., by gaining their trust). It's funny to think of the type of experiment wherein the mice's trust would be required, because experiments with mice usually involve only testing medications, etc.

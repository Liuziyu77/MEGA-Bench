# Task: planning_visual_storage

## Task Description:

```
Your goal is to move all crates to a depot. There are 5 actions in the domain:

lift: the action lifts a crate using a hoist from a store area to an area that is connected to it, and places the crate in a place, format: (lift [hoist] [crate] [storearea] [area] [place])
The preconditions for the "lift" action require that the hoist is available, the hoist is at the destination area, the crate is on the surface in the source store area, and the source store area is in the place.
The effects of the "lift" action remove the crate from the source store area, make the source area clear, make the hoist unavailable, make the hoist lifting the crate, and remove the crate from the place.

drop: the action drops a crate from the hoist onto a surface in a store area that is connected to the area where the hoist is currently located, format: (drop [hoist] [crate] [storearea] [area] [place])
The preconditions for the "drop" action require that the hoist is at the destination area, the hoist is lifting the crate, the destination store area is clear, and the destination store area is in the place.
The effects of the "drop" action remove the hoist lifting the crate, make the hoist available, make the destination area occupied by the crate, and make the crate in the destination store area.

move: the action moves a hoist from one store area to another connected store area, format: (move [hoist] [storearea_from] [storearea_to])
The preconditions for the "move" action require that the hoist is in the source store area, the destination store area is clear, and the source and destination areas are connected.
The effects of the "move" action remove the hoist from the source area, place the hoist in the destination area, make the source area occupied, and make the destination area clear.

go-out: the action moves a hoist from a store area to a transit area that is connected to it, format: (go-out [hoist] [storearea_from] [transitarea_to])
The preconditions for the "go-out" action require that the hoist is in the source store area, and the source and destination areas are connected.
The effects of the "go-out" action remove the hoist from the source area, place the hoist in the transit area, and make the source area clear.

go-in: the action moves a hoist from a transit area to a store area that is connected to it, format: (go-in [hoist] [transitarea_from] [storearea_to])
The preconditions for the "go-in" action require that the hoist is in the transit area, the source and destination areas are connected, and the destination area is clear.
The effects of the "go-in" action remove the hoist from the transit area, place the hoist in the destination store area, and make the destination store area occupied.

## The 1-shot Example for Task Demonstration:

```
Demonstration example(s) of the task:
Example 1:
```

```
Example Question: You are provided with an image of the initial state, including the location of hoist the load area and the crates. The depot area is denoted as depot48-[row]-[col], starting from the upper left corner as depot48-1-1. The container store area is denoted as container-0-[col], starting from the left as container-0-0.
Please output an executable plan to move all the crates to depot48 (one depot store area can only store one crate), in the way of a sequence of actions, to solve the problem. Follow the provided action format.
Example Response:
[PLEASE OUTPUT YOUR REASONING]
Answer: (go-out hoist0 depot48-1-2 loadarea)
(lift hoist0 crate0 container-0-0 loadarea container0)
(drop hoist0 crate0 depot48-1-2 loadarea depot48)
Answer the new question below. The last part of your response should be of the following format: "Answer: <YOUR ANSWER>" (without angle brackets) where YOUR ANSWER is your answer, following the same task logic and output format of the demonstration example(s). For your answer, do not output additional contents that violate the specified format. Think step by step before answering.

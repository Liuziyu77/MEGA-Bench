# Task: number_puzzle_sudoku

## Task Description:

```
Here are the rules of Sudoku:

1. **Grid Layout**: A standard Sudoku puzzle consists of a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids or regions.

2. **Objective**: The goal is to fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 so that:
   - Each row contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.
   - Each column contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.
   - Each 3x3 subgrid contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once.

3. **Given Numbers**: The puzzle starts with some cells already filled with numbers. These are called "given" or "clue" numbers.

4. **No Repetition**: No number can repeat in any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

5. **Uniqueness**: A well-designed Sudoku puzzle has only one solution. 

Please provide a 9x9 grid of characters outlining the solution for the given Sodoku puzzle.

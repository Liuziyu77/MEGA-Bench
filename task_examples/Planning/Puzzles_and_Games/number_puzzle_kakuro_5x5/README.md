# Task: number_puzzle_kakuro_5x5

## Task Description:

```
**Kakuro** is a logic puzzle that combines elements of Sudoku and crosswords. The goal is to fill in all the blank spaces on a grid with digits from 1 to 9, such that the sum of the numbers in each horizontal or vertical group matches the clue for that group. Additionally, no digit may be repeated within any group.

Here are the basic rules:

1. **Grid Layout**: 
   - The grid consists of blank squares (where numbers will be filled) and clue squares (which provide the sum that the numbers in the corresponding row or column must add up to). Clue squares are shaded and usually have two numbers: one for the sum of the row and one for the sum of the column.

2. **Clue Squares**: 
   - Clue squares are divided by a diagonal line. The number in the top right indicates the sum of the digits in the row to the right of that square. The number in the bottom left indicates the sum of the digits in the column below that square.
   - If a clue square has only one number, it could mean that it applies only to the row or the column.

3. **Filling in the Grid**: 
   - Each blank square must be filled with a digit from 1 to 9.
   - The digits in each group (a sequence of consecutive blank squares either horizontally or vertically connected to a clue square) must add up to the number indicated by the clue square.
   - No digit can be repeated in a group. For example, if a row clue is 6, and the group has two blank squares, the only valid combination is 1 and 5 (or vice versa), since using the digit 3 twice is not allowed.

4. **Strategy**:
   - Use logic to determine the placement of numbers, considering the possible combinations that can sum up to the given clue numbers.
   - The puzzle is completed correctly when all blank squares are filled with numbers that satisfy the sum clues, with no repeated digits in any group.

Please solve the Kakuro puzzle in the attached image. The answer should be a NxM array of characters, either a numeric digit from 0 to 9 or a ".".   - The puzzle is completed correctly when all blank squares are filled with numbers that satisfy the sum clues, with no repeated digits in any group.

Please solve the Kakuro puzzle in the attached image. The answer should be a NxM array of characters, either a numeric digit from 0 to 9 or a ".".

For instance, a 3x3 grid of numbers from 1-9 would be formatted like so:
ˋˋˋ
123
456
789
ˋˋˋ

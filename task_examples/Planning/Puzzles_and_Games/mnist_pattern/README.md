# Task: mnist_pattern

## Task Description:

```
You are shown an image of a decimal number and an output string. In the example image, we apply the function \(f(x) = x^2+b\) for some integer \(b\), which is used for all outputs. Write out the number in ternary, with no leading 0s. Negative numbers will be written like positive numbers but with a hyphen: for example, -3 in decimal will be written as -10 in ternary for this task.

To repeat how we generate the output, we first
1. Apply \(f(x)\).
2. Convert the output to ternary.

Following the same pattern, apply this rule to the new input image (the most recent image).

Example Question: Guess which option (A ~ F) best fits into the "?" in the provided image. Before writing an answer, elaborate on your thought process by analyzing the pattern.
Example Response: Answer: The instruction asks to guess which option best fits into the "?" inside the image.

For each row, there is a commonality between the 3 images.
- The first row has 4 dots placed at the vertex of a square.
- The second row has an iron cross which is a variation of a four-pointed star.
- Likewise, the third row should have a square that surrounds another object in the middle.

For each column, there is a commonality between the 3 images.
- The first column has a circle placed in the middle.
- The second column has a plus sign placed in the middle.
- Likewise, the third column should have a rotated square in the middle.

Based on these observations, the best object that fits into the "?" should have a rotated square in the middle and a larger square that surrounds it.
Therefore, the answer is E.

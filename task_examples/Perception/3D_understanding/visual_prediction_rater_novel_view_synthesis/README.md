# Task: visual_prediction_rater_novel_view_synthesis

## Task Description:

```
Novel view synthesis involves generating new perspectives of an object based on a given input view. Your task is to evaluate the generated views for their consistency with the original image, focusing on the object's structure, texture, and overall appearance.

The first image is the input view; the remaining images are the generated views. Rank the generated views based on how well they maintain consistency with the original object. Use their indices, starting with 1, and exclude the input image from the ranking.

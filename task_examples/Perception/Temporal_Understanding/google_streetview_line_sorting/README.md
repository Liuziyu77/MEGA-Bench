# Task: google_streetview_line_sorting

## Task Description:

```
The photographer is walking on a street or a road. He took a photo every time he walked a short distance, but the order of the photos input was disrupted. Please use the first photo as the fixed one and re-arrange the other photos according to the order in which they were taken. The output format is a list of the photo serial number (like [1, 3, 6, 2, 5, 4]). For example if the 3rd element is the number 6, then it means in the correct order the 3rd photo should be the 6th photo in the input.

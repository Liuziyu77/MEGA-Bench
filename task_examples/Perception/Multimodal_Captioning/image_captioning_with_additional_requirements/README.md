# Task: Image captioning with additional requirements

## Task Description:

```
# Image Analysis and Caption Generation Task

Given an image, perform the following tasks:

1. Short Caption:
   - Provide a concise, one-sentence caption that summarizes the main subject or action in the image.

2. Detailed Description:
   - Write a comprehensive paragraph describing every significant detail observed in the image. Include information about:
     - Main subjects/objects
     - Actions or events taking place
     - Background and setting
     - Colors, lighting, and atmosphere
     - Any notable textures, patterns, or unique features

3. Text Extraction:
   - If the image contains any visible text, extract and list all text elements found.

4. Structured Output:
   - Compile the results into a JSON format with the following structure:

ˋˋˋjson
{
  "short_caption": "One-sentence summary of the image",
  "detailed_description": "Comprehensive paragraph describing all observed details...",
  "extracted_text": [
    "List",
    "of",
    "any",
    "text",
    "found",
    "in",
    "the",
    "image"
  ]
}
ˋˋˋ

Note: If no text is found in the image, the "extracted_text" field should be an empty array.

Example Response: Answer: Here's the structured output based on the image analysis:

ˋˋˋjson
{
  "short_caption": "A diagram illustrating different types of practices and their characteristics.",
  "detailed_description": "The image presents a quadrant-style diagram that categorizes different types of practices and their associated characteristics. The diagram is divided into four sections: Complex, Complicated, Chaotic, and Clear. Each quadrant contains a main practice type (Emergent Practice, Good Practice, Novel Practice, and Best Practice respectively) along with descriptors for constraints and coupling. The design uses a warm orange color scheme with curved lines forming a diamond shape in the center. Text is presented in black and orange, with the main categories in large, bold text and supporting details in smaller font sizes. The layout is symmetrical and organized, making it easy to compare and contrast the different types of practices and their attributes.",
  "extracted_text": [
    "COMPLEX",
    "COMPLICATED",
    "Enabling constraints",
    "Governing constraints",
    "Loosely coupled",
    "Tightly coupled",
    "probe-sense-respond",
    "sense-analyze-respond",
    "EMERGENT",
    "GOOD",
    "PRACTICE",
    "PRACTICE",
    "CHAOTIC",
    "CLEAR",
    "Lacking constraint",
    "Tightly constrained",
    "De-coupled",
    "No degrees of freedom",

    "sense-categorize-respond",
    "NOVEL",

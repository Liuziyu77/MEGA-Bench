# Task: Visual prediction rater panoptic segmentation

## Task Description:

```
Panoptic segmentation is a combination of instance segmentation and semantic segmentation. Panoptic segmentation assigns a unique label to each pixel, distinguishing between different object instances (e.g., different people or cars) as well as classifying background regions (e.g., sky, road) into predefined categories.

Your task is to understand the quality of panoptic segmentation. Given an input image or a ground truth result followed by a list of panoptic segmentation results, you should rank the results from the best quality to the worst. You should judge the quality based on consistency with the input or ground-truth image, alignments with semantic commonsense of objects and instances, and clarity for fine-grained details. Do not count the input/ground-truth image for the index. The index of the first result is 1, and your answer should be a sequence of index.

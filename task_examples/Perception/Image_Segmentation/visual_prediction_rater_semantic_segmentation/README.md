# Task: Visual prediction rater semantic segmentation

## Task Description:

```
Semantic segmentation is a fundamental visual task where each pixel of an image is assigned a label based on the semantic class it belongs to. Your task is to understand the quality of semantic segmentation. Given a list of semantic segmentation results of the same image, you should rank the result from the best quality to the worst. For some examples, the picture overlays the input image and the semantic segmentation output, where a single color represents a class label. For some other examples, a clean input image is given as the first image. You should judge the quality based on consistency with the raw image, alignments with semantic commonsense, and clarity for fine-grained details. The index of the first result is 1.

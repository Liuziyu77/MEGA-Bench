Example Question: Based on this image, what kind of living strategy would be appropriate if you were a sea duck?
Example Response: Answer: If you were a sea duck in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, as depicted in the food web, an appropriate living strategy would involve several key components:
1. **Diet**: You would primarily eat bivalves, as they are indicated as a food source for sea ducks in this food web. Bivalves include various types of clams, mussels, and oysters, which are common in the Chesapeake Bay.
2. **Foraging Behavior**: You would need to develop foraging strategies that allow you to efficiently locate and consume bivalves. This could involve diving to reach the bivalves where they live on the bottom or in the sediment.
3. **Habitat Preference**: Since bivalves are often found in shallow waters where they can filter-feed, as a sea duck, you would likely spend a significant amount of time in such habitats to access your food efficiently.
4. **Predator Awareness**: The food web shows that sea ducks can be preyed upon by larger piscivorous (fish-eating) birds, so you would need to be vigilant for predators like the Bald Eagle.
5. **Seasonal Migration**: Depending on the specific type of sea duck, you might migrate seasonally, which would require you to know when to travel to different areas for breeding or to find more abundant food sources.

Living as a sea duck in this ecosystem would mean adapting to the available food sources and being aware of the position in the food web, both as a consumer and as potential prey.

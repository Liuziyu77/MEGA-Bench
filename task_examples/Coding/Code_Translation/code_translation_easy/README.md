# Task: code_translation_easy

## Task Description:

```
You are required to translate a given code, presented in given image(s), into Python. The code handles input and output through the console. The input consists of multiple lines, where each line contains several characters separated by spaces. Your Python program should replicate the functionality of the provided code by reading the input line by line, processing each line accordingly, and producing the corresponding output in the console. Ensure that your code correctly interprets the input format and matches the output shown in the example.
```

Example Response:
[PLEASE OUTPUT YOUR REASONING]
Answer: def main():
    # Read the input as a single string and split it into two parts
    n_str, ch = input().split()  # input split into number and character
    n = int(n_str)  # Convert the first part to an integer

    sum = 1
    i = 1

    # Find the largest odd i where the sum of the pyramid's character count doesn't exceed n
    while sum <= n:
        i += 2
        sum += 2 * i

    sum -= 2 * i  # Adjust sum back to the correct value
    i -= 2  # Reduce i to the maximum size of the pyramid

    # Print the pyramid
    for k in range(i):
        if k <= i // 2:
            print(" " * k + ch * (i - 2 * k))
        else:
            print(" " * (k - 2 * (k - i // 2)) + ch * (2 * k - i + 2))

    # Print the remaining number of characters
    print(n - sum)

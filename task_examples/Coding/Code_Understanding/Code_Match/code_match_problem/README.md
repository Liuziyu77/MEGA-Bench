Example Question: Problem-1:{You are given n × m table. Each cell of the table is colored white or black. Find the number of non-empty sets of cells such that:  All cells in a set have the same color.  Every two cells in a set share row or column. }, Problem-2:{Polycarp has a poor memory. Each day he can remember no more than $$$3$$$ of different letters. Polycarp wants to write a non-empty string of $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters, taking minimum number of days. In how many days will he be able to do it?Polycarp initially has an empty string and can only add characters to the end of that string.For example, if Polycarp wants to write the string lollipops, he will do it in $$$2$$$ days:   on the first day Polycarp will memorize the letters l, o, i and write lolli;  On the second day Polycarp will remember the letters p, o, s, add pops to the resulting line and get the line lollipops. If Polycarp wants to write the string stringology, he will do it in $$$4$$$ days:   in the first day will be written part str;  on day two will be written part ing;  on the third day, part of olog will be written;  on the fourth day, part of y will be written. For a given string $$$s$$$, print the minimum number of days it will take Polycarp to write it.}, Problem-3:{Every year Santa Claus gives gifts to all children. However, each country has its own traditions, and this process takes place in different ways. For example, in Berland you need to solve the New Year's puzzle.Polycarp got the following problem: given a grid strip of size $$$2 \times n$$$, some cells of it are blocked. You need to check if it is possible to tile all free cells using the $$$2 \times 1$$$ and $$$1 \times 2$$$ tiles (dominoes).For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the strip looks like this (black cells are blocked):  Then it can be tiled, for example, using two vertical and two horizontal tiles, as in the picture below (different tiles are marked by different colors).  And if $$$n = 3$$$ and the strip looks like this:  It is impossible to tile free cells.Polycarp easily solved this task and received his New Year's gift. Can you solve it?}, Problem-4:{Imagine that Alice is playing a card game with her friend Bob. They both have exactly $$$8$$$ cards and there is an integer on each card, ranging from $$$0$$$ to $$$4$$$. In each round, Alice or Bob in turns choose two cards from different players, let them be $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, where $$$a$$$ is the number on the player's card, and $$$b$$$ is the number on the opponent's card. It is necessary that $$$a \cdot b \ne 0$$$. Then they calculate $$$c = (a + b) \bmod 5$$$ and replace the number $$$a$$$ with $$$c$$$. The player who ends up with numbers on all $$$8$$$ cards being $$$0$$$, wins.Now Alice wants to know who wins in some situations. She will give you her cards' numbers, Bob's cards' numbers and the person playing the first round. Your task is to determine who wins if both of them choose the best operation in their rounds.}, Problem-5:{A batch of $$$n$$$ goods ($$$n$$$ — an even number) is brought to the store, $$$i$$$-th of which has weight $$$a_i$$$. Before selling the goods, they must be packed into packages. After packing, the following will be done:   There will be $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ packages, each package contains exactly two goods;  The weight of the package that contains goods with indices $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$) is $$$a_i + a_j$$$. With this, the cost of a package of weight $$$x$$$ is always $$$\left \lfloor\frac{x}{k}\right\rfloor$$$ burles (rounded down), where $$$k$$$ — a fixed and given value.Pack the goods to the packages so that the revenue from their sale is maximized. In other words, make such $$$\frac{n}{2}$$$ pairs of given goods that the sum of the values $$$\left \lfloor\frac{x_i}{k} \right \rfloor$$$, where $$$x_i$$$ is the weight of the package number $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le \frac{n}{2}$$$), is maximal.For example, let $$$n = 6, k = 3$$$, weights of goods $$$a = [3, 2, 7, 1, 4, 8]$$$. Let's pack them into the following packages.   In the first package we will put the third and sixth goods. Its weight will be $$$a_3 + a_6 = 7 + 8 = 15$$$. The cost of the package will be $$$\left \lfloor\frac{15}{3}\right\rfloor = 5$$$ burles.  In the second package put the first and fifth goods, the weight is $$$a_1 + a_5 = 3 + 4 = 7$$$. The cost of the package is $$$\left \lfloor\frac{7}{3}\right\rfloor = 2$$$ burles.  In the third package put the second and fourth goods, the weight is $$$a_2 + a_4 = 2 + 1 = 3$$$. The cost of the package is $$$\left \lfloor\frac{3}{3}\right\rfloor = 1$$$ burle. With this packing, the total cost of all packs would be $$$5 + 2 + 1 = 8$$$ burles.}

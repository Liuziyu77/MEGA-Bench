# Task: Math breakpoint

## Task Description:

```
You are given a plot of a real-valued, scalar function f(x).
YOUR TASK is to count the number of breakpoints in the plot of f(x). A breakpoint refers to a point on the functionâ€™s domain
at which the function changes its slope. You should IGNORE the left and right end point of the domain, i.e. if the function
is defined on [a, b], you should only consider the domain (a, b).
Respond with the number of breakpoints (in Arab digits) on how many breakpoints the function f(x) contains based on the
definition above.

## Task Description:

```
You are given two undirected graphs in the image. YOUR TASK is to solve the graph isomorphism (GI) problem given two undirected graphs.
Definition of GI problem:
The graph isomorphism (GI) problem is a computational problem that asks if two finite graphs are isomorphic, or have the same structure even if they look different.
Please output "true" if two graphs in the image are isomorphic, or "false" otherwise.

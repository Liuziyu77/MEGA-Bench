# Task: graph_connectivity

## Task Description:

```
You are given a graph and two query nodes in the image. YOUR TASK is to solve the connectivity problem given the graph.
Definition of the connectivity problem:
Two nodes in a graph are considered connected if there's at least one path between two nodes.
A subgraph is connected if every pairs of nodes in the subgraph is connected.
A connected component is a maximal connected subgraph of an undirected graph.
Please first output "true" if two query nodes are connected in the graph, or "false" otherwise. Then output the number of connected components in the given graph.
```
